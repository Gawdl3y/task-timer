{"name":"Task Timer","tagline":"The repository for both the Android and Chrome versions of Task Timer","body":"﻿### Welcome to the Task Timer GitHub project\r\nThis project houses both the Chrome and Android versions of Task Timer, the simple app to keep track of time you spend on \"tasks\", which can be pretty much anything you want.\r\nThe Android version is currently under development, and will be released soon™.\r\n\r\n## Task Timer on Chrome\r\nYou can add Task Timer to Chrome by downloading it from the Chrome Web Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/task-timer/aomfjmibjhhfdenfkpaodhnlhkolngif).\r\nAlternatively, you can download one of the release zips in the [releases directory](https://github.com/Gawdl3y/task-timer/tree/master/releases) and load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome.\r\n\r\n## Task Timer on Android\r\nComing soon, stay tuned!\r\n\r\n## Task Timer on the web\r\nThere is a web version of Task Timer, but it is extremely old compared to the Chrome version. It is still usable, though. You can access it [here](http://gawdl3y.github.com/task-timer/timer/).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
